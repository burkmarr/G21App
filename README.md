The Gilbert 21 Android app (G21App)
===================================

The G21App is an Android app for the Gilbert 21 project.

The Gilbert 21 project provides free biological recording software for people who want to record wildlife and use their records to learn about natural history. You can read more about the background to the project here: http://www.gilbert21.org.uk

The G21App adds an exciting new way to collect the raw sound files in the field that are used in the Gilbert 21 paradigm to make biological records. It brings the versatility and power of a dedicated data logger within the reach of anyone with an Android phone without having to pay for, and carry, a separate data logger.

The G21App was created in 2014 as a freely available app and became an open source project in 2017.
